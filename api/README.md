# Flask API
The flask API will be a RESTful API serving training data generated by the NEAT genetic algorithm. It is run as a containerised application with Docker.

## Getting Started
_Note:_ This is assumes you have a similar ```.env``` to the [sample ```.env```](#sample-env-file).

1.	 Make sure you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed.

2.	Open your terminal at 'api/' or change it to 'api/' from the repository root directory:
    ```shell
    $ cd api/
    ```
    
3.	Setup the .env file. See the following [section](#configuring-environment-settings) on configuring environment settings.
 
4.	Build with Docker Compose:
    ```shell
    $ docker-compose build
    ```
    
5.	Start the API:
    ```shell
    $ docker-compose up -d
    ```
    
6.	Test the API:
    ```shell
    $ curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/api
    {
        "hello": "world"
    }
    ```
    or go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your web browser.
    
7.	Open psql on the PostgreSQL server:
    ```shell
    $ docker exec -it api_postgres_1 sh
    / # psql ${POSTGRES_DB} --username=${POSTGRES_USER}
    ```
    You can quit psql with ```\q``` and exit the docker container with ```exit```.
 
8.  Open pgadmin by navigating to http://127.0.0.1:5050/ in your web browser.
    To connect to the PostgreSQL database add a new database via the GUI and for the address enter ```172.18.0.2```. 
    _Note:_ This IP address may be different when you run it. To check what IP address the server is running on run the command:
    ```bash
    $ docker inspect -f '{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' <postgresql_container_name>
    ```
    
9.  Stop the API:
    ```shell
    $ docker-compose stop
    ```
    
## Configuring Environment Settings
The flask server and PostgreSQL database require some environment variables to be set. These can be passed to Docker Compose via a .env file. To ensure that everything is setup correctly follow these steps:
1.	Create the file ```.env``` in the ```api/``` directory.
    ```shell
    $ cd api/
    $ touch .env
    ```
    
2.	Fill in the following fields:
    1.	POSTGRES_USER
    2.	POSTGRES_PASSWORD
    3.	POSTGRES_DB
    4.	POSTGRES_PORT
    5.  PG_ADMIN_EMAIL
    6.  PG_ADMIN_PASSWORD
    7.  PG_ADMIN_PORT
    8.	FLASK_PORT

### Sample ```.env``` File
Your ```.env``` file may look like this:
```text
POSTGRES_USER=AzureDiamond
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=hunter2
POSTGRES_DB=bash_irc_chat_log
POSTGRES_PORT=5432
PG_ADMIN_EMAIL=AzureDiamond@bashirc.com
PG_ADMIN_PASSWORD=hunter2
PG_ADMIN_PORT=5050
FLASK_PORT=5000
```
